This repo is a simple guide for Polygraphy CLI. Please refer to the jupyter notebook for details.

Polygraphy is a toolkit designed to assist in running and debugging deep learning models in various frameworks. It is a part of TensorRT OSS. You can learn the source code from the [repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/tools/Polygraphy). 
It includes a Python API and a command-line interface (CLI) built using this API. 

The onnx model and calibration cache used in this guide come from another [repo](https://github.com/shiyongming/TensorRT_quantization_demo_cifar10).

If you want to learn how to use the python API, please see details in Polygraphy_API folder.
